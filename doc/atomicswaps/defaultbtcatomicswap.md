#  Cross chain atomic swap walkthrough using the Bitcoin Core client.

## required tools  
In order to execute atomic swaps as described in this document, you need to run the core tfchain daemon and client, available from https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tfchain/releases, the [Bitcoin Core full node client](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/) and the atomic swap tools that are available at https://github.com/rivine/decredatomicswap/releases. 

The original decred atomic swap project is [Decred atomic swaps](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap), the rivine fork just supplies the binaries.
 
## Example

Let's assume Bob wants to buy 567 TFT from Alice for 0.1234BTC

Bob creates a bitcoin address and Alice creates a threefold address.

Bob initiates the swap, he generates a 32-byte secret and hashes it
using the SHA256 algorithm, resulting in a 32-byte hashed secret.

Bob now creates a swap transaction, as a smart contract, and publishes it on the Bitcoin chain, it has 0.1234BTC as an output and the output can be redeemed (used as input) using either 1 of the following conditions:
- timeout has passed (48hours) and claimed by Bob's refund address;
- the money is claimed by Alice's registered address and the secret is given that hashes to the hashed secret created by Bob 

This means Alice can claim the bitcoin if she has the secret and if the atomic swap process fails, Bob can always reclaim it's btc after the timeout.

 Bob sends this contract and the transaction id of this transaction on the bitcoin chain to Alice, making sure he does not share the secret of course.

 Now Alice validates if everything is as agreed (=audit)after which She creates a similar transaction on the Rivine chain but with a timeout for refund of only 24 hours and she uses the same hashsecret as the first contract for Bob to claim the tokens.
 This transaction has 9876 tokens as an output and the output can be redeemed( used as input) using either 1 of the following conditions:
- timeout has passed ( 24hours) and claimed by the sellers refund address
- the secret is given that hashes to the hashsecret Bob created (= same one as used in the bitcoin swap transaction) and claimed by the buyers's address

In order for Bob to claim the threefold tokens, he has to use and as such disclose the secret.

The magic of the atomic swap lies in the fact that the same secret is used to claim the tokens in both swap transactions but it is not disclosed in the contracts because only the hash of the secret is used there. The moment Bob claims the threefold tokens, he discloses the secret and Alice has enough time lef to claim the bitcoin because the timeout of the first contract is longer than the one of the second contract.
Of course, either Bob or Alice can be the initiator or the participant.

## Technical details of the example
This example is a walkthrough of an actual atomic swap  on the threefold and bitcoin testnets.
 

Start bitcoin core qt in server mode on testnet: 
`./Bitcoin-Qt  -testnet -server -rpcuser=user -rpcpassword=pass -rpcport=18332`
Start the tfchain daemon on testnet:
`tfchaind --network testnet`

Alice creates a new bitcoin  address (as of bitcoin core 0.16, make sure to specify the 'legacy' address type since we need a p2pkh address)and provides this to Bob: 
```ï¿¼
getnewaddress "" legacy
muQ1J2UMfekrRJqEgXM59AuFm2az7y94V3
```

### initiate step
Bob initiates the process by using btcatomicswap to pay 0.1234BTC into the Bitcoin contract using Alice's Bit coin address, sending the contract transaction, and sharing the secret hash (not the secret), and contract's transaction with Alice. The refund transaction can not be sent until the locktime expires, but should be saved in case a refund is necessary.

command:`btcatomicswap initiate <participant address> <amount>`

You can check the transaction [on a bitcoin testnet blockexplorer](https://testnet.blockexplorer.com/tx/b0a4d6a6423ae62d77e0ae79d5b6b39a8946cbcd9d3f127999f96c69bf67421f) where you can see that 0.1234 BTC is sent to 2N22npr3a5JiSMpZDeeQeY3FVfjBwzvkwuW (= the contract script hash) being a [p2sh](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash) address in the bitcoin testnet. 


 ### audit contract

Bob sends Alice the contract and the contract transaction. Alice should now verify if
- the script is correct 
- the locktime is far enough in the future
- the amount is correct
- she is the recipient 

command:`btcatomicswap auditcontract <contract> <contract transaction>`

WARNING:
A check on the blockchain should be done as the auditcontract does not do that so an already spent output could have been used as an input. Checking if the contract has been mined in a block should suffice

### Participate

Alice trusts the contract so she participates in the atomic swap by paying the tokens into a threefold token  contract using the same secret hash. 

Bob creates a new threefold address ( or uses an existing one): 
```
tfchainc wallet address
Created new address: 01ba82c45bc004a7a4a169c7daade3422c59158981044e4f341e7cea57a2852a36ea43e9fc25bb
```

Bob sends this address to Alice who uses it to participate in the swap.
command:`tfchainc atomicswap participate <initiator address> <amount> <secret hash>`
```
$ ./tfchainc atomicswap participate 01ba82c45bc004a7a4a169c7daade3422c59158981044e4f341e7cea57a2852a36ea43e9fc25bb 567 8b445001958277e6372424625d31e649e32812eeb62eece03ff616a31ebd0f6b

The above command will create a transaction with `567` TFT as the Output  value of the output (`15504a2eee64101ca04f4246bf9358db501397947a37b231454be66d1a3e5e7e`).

Alice now informs Bob that the Threefold contract transaction has been created and provides him with the contract details.

### audit Threefold contract

Just as Alice had to audit Bob's contract, Bob now has to do the same with Alice's contract before withdrawing. 
Bob verifies if:
- the amount of threefold tokens () defined in the output is correct
- the attached script is correct
- the locktime, hashed secret (`ed7c9cb48bf06db077641a09a0b7f7c3cc688760b771811fc0a0d07bdd3c6fa5`) and wallet address, defined in the attached script, are correct

command:`./tfchainc atomicswap auditcontract outputid`
flags are available to automatically check the information in the contract.
```
$ ./tfchainc atomicswap auditcontract 15504a2eee64101ca04f4246bf9358db501397947a37b231454be66d1a3e5e7e

```

The audit also checks if that the given contract's output has not already been spend.

### redeem tokens

Now that both Bob and Alice have paid into their respective contracts, Bob may withdraw from the Threefold contract. This step involves publishing a transaction which reveals the secret to Alice, allowing her to withdraw from the Bitcoin contract.

command:`/tfchainc atomicswap redeem outputid secret`

```
$ ./tfchainc atomicswap redeem 15504a2eee64101ca04f4246bf9358db501397947a37b231454be66d1a3e5e7e 9cddc24ba8e77d868c97e98374f4a2447aab114fa6f62a35d53f636c092f5257

### redeem bitcoins

Now that Bob has withdrawn from the rivine contract and revealed the secret. If bob is really nice he could simply give the secret to Alice. However,even if he doesn't do this Alice can extract the secret from this redemption transaction. Alice may watch a block explorer to see when the rivine contract output was spent and look up the redeeming transaction.

Alice can automatically extract the secret from the input where it is used by Bob, by simply giving the outputID of the contract. Either you do this using a public web-based explorer, by looking up the outputID as hash. Or you let the command line client do it automatically for you:

command:`tfchainc atomicswap extractsecret transactionid`
```
$./tfchainc atomicswap extractsecret 1d4428d7651710c9630a3c150277fd24c504f8a30e0a9d338f04e819aeed48db

```

With the secret known (extracted from the coinInput with parent OutputID `9cddc24ba8e77d868c97e98374f4a2447aab114fa6f62a35d53f636c092f5257`), Alice may redeem from Bob's Bitcoin contract:
command: `btcatomicswap redeem <contract> <contract transaction> <secret>`
```
