 # Coin Creation concept 

 As stated  in the Threefold whitepaper:
 
 "
 ThreeFold Farmers (“TF Farmer” or “Farmer”) are independent, individuals or entities who invest in IT equipment consisting of storage and compute servers (“Farming Pools”), thus becoming ThreeFold Nodes (“TF Nodes” or “Nodes”), that are connected to the TF Grid and are registered on the TF Chain.
 "

To start off the grid, a lot of capacity has already been added to Threefold grid but the automatic validation has not been implemented yet. In order to compensate for these investments according to the Threefold principles, an alternative coin creation strategy has been created.
Capacity, added to the grid will be manually validated by a number of members from the Threefold Foundation and they will have to collaboratively agree to create and assign new Threefoldtokens with a  description of the capacity proof ( or a hash of it so it can never be modified Later).
A mechanism has also been implemented to  modify this authority if the same people collaboratively agree to this, for example to remove or add a validator.
Not only are the validators defined this way, also the number of signatures required is stated. A common rule would require 9 out of 12 validators for example to agree  on a coin creation based on the Theefold principles before it is accepted by the network.
