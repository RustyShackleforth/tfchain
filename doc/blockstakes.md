# Block Stakes

The standard network has a finite amount of block stakes of `500`. Initially `400` have been reserved for the threefold foundation and ambassadors, while `100`, one each, were given to all `100` initial ThreeFold nodes.

Currently these block stakes are no further distributed beyond this initial distribution, how the distribution will play out in the future is unclear however, and could/should be much more spread. For now however the ThreeFold Foundation wishes to remain in control of the block stakes, togher with early investors, as it's still beta.

A block stake (BS) is an alternative token, which is finite, and is used to create blocks. Therefore it can be said that each blockcreator has at least one block stake. The more (active/matured) block stakes a block creator has the more chance they have to create the next block.

You can read more about block stakes in [the rivine documentation](https://github.com/threefoldtech/rivine/tree/master/doc) at https://github.com/threefoldtech/rivine/blob/master/doc/ProofOfBlockStake.md, which focuses on block stakes eas well as on the Proof Of Block Stake (POBS) algorithm.
