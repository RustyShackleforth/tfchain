# autobuilds

using [autobuilder](https://hub.grid.tf/tf-autobuilder) we provide `flists` on commits (for master, and development branches)

## configurations
TFChain [configurations](https://github.com/threefoldtech/flist-builder-config/tree/master/threefoldfoundation/tfchain)

## autobuild script
the [buildscript](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tfchain/blob/master/autobuild/tfchain.sh) is triggered by autobuilder and the builds can be [monitored](build.grid.tf/)
