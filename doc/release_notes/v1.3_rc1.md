# Releasenotes Threefold chain v1.3-rc1

This release on itself was never released as production-ready.

## Summary

- adds blocking accounts to support transition to another blockchain platform.
  - The auth coin transfer extension provides the ability to ensure only authorized addresses can receive/send coins. Only the condition authorized to do so is able to define which addresses are authorized and which aren't. The condition that defines who is authorized to do so can also only changed by the one(s) owning the current condition authorized to do this and the address authorization.
  - In this tfchain implementation an address is by default authorized.
  - it introduces 2 new Transaction Types in the tfchain network to support this feature:
      - Auth Address Update Transaction ([Tx v176][Tx_v176]);
      - Auth Condition Update Transaction ([Tx v177][Tx_v177]);
