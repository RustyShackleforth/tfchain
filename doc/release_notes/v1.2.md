# Releasenotes Threefold chain v1.2

This release also includes changes made, but not prior released in a production-ready release,
for the [v1.1.2-rc1 candidate release](./v1.1.2_rc1.md).

## Summary

- bug fixes and improvements to web explorer, some of the more important improvements:
  - render arbitrary data decoded only if possible;
  - show timestamps on transaction pages;
  - fix all known runtime errors;
- introduce the TFT <-> TFT20 (an ERC20 ThreefoldFoundation-backed token on Ethereum) bridge (_testnet_ only):
    - it comes with a bridged CLI that forms a bridge between networks, allowing transfers of funds from one network to the other;
    - it introduces 3 new Transaction Types in the tfchain network to support this feature:
        - one to send funds from TFT to TFT20 ([Tx v208][Tx_v208]);
        - one to receive TFT funds from the TFT network ([v209][Tx_v209]);
        - one to register a TFT withdrawal address, required in order to be able to send TFT20 funds (back) to the TFT network) ([v210][Tx_v210]);
    - [Tx v208][Tx_v208] and [v210][Tx_v210] can be fully validated by any tfchain daemon;
    - [v209][Tx_v209] is by default only validated in light-mode. Only a tfchain daemon also connected to the linked Ethereum network can validate the ERC20-backed CoinCreation fully (a recommendation for all block creators);
    - includes a command-line client for the bridge;
- introduce support for 3Bot records (_testnet_ only):
    - you can read more about 3Bot in the context of tfchain at [/doc/3bot.md](/doc/3bot.md);
    - it comes with 3 new Transaction Types in the tfchain network to support this feature:
        - one to register a 3Bot, creating the record and getting a unique integral ID assigned as a result ([Tx v144][Tx_v144]);
        - one to update the record of an existing 3Bot ([Tx v145][Tx_v145]);
        - one to transfer the ownership of one or multiple names from one existing 3Bot to another ([Tx v146][Tx_v146]);
- improved _tfchaind_ daemon:
  - support unencrypted (plain) wallets;
  - support verbose logging;
  - provide more information for hash lookups in explorers, avoiding the need to look up parent blocks;
  - allow for extensive runtime profiling when building using the profile Makefile targets;
- improve the TFT (_testnet_) faucet and also provide it with an API;
- some small corrections in documentation;
- update codebase and get it up to date with Rivine:
    - switch to the consensus plugin-based system, eliminating the need for the transactionDB
      (the persistent data of this DB is to be manually deleted by the user);
    - update all vendored dependencies (dep);
    - get codebase up to date with Rivine's new codebase;
    - move threebot code to extension internal package;
    - remove most internal erc20 logic and use the new rivine erc20 extension;
    - adapt and fix codebase where needed;
    - improve linting, formatting and testing;
    - integrate latest rivinecg faucet (closes #369);
    - improved logging during the consensus IBD phase;
    - ensure explorer frontend JS code is up to date with latest bug fixes and features (closes #368);
    - closes #363, closes #362, closes #354, closes #357, closes #351 (disabled for standard net) and also closes #350 (disabled for standard net);

## Upgrade concerns

- Make sure to upgrade your full node, connected to the _testnet_ ThreeFold Chain network, to `v1.1.2` immediately, as your node(s) will no longer sync otherwise.
- Starting from block `385,000` v0 transactions are no longer accepted by consensus nodes on both the standard and testnet network;
- Miner fees were already required since a previous patch and are now enforced to be since block `300,000` on both the standard and testnet network;
