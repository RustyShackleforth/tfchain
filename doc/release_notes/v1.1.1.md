# Releasenotes Threefold chain v1.1.1

## Important for light clients

The explorer can now return unconfirmed transactions as well when an unlock address is queried. An additional `unconfirmed` boolean field has been added in the
json of the transactions returned. Since the client will likely not filter on this field yet, the client might think that the transaction is confirmed. This can
lead to problems with incorrect calculation of balances, duplicate outputs if the client already searched through the transactionpool, and possibly more. The logic
which retrieves the relevant transactions should be updated as soon as possible.

## Summary

* Improved JumpScale client support:
  * Added support for coin creation and minter definition transactions
  * Improved the handeling of multisig outputs
  * Rework how the balance is shown
  * The client now starts with only a single address
  * Small bugfixes
* Unconfirmed transactions are now returned when looking up an unlock hash in the explorer
* Daemons can now try to broadcast transactions again should they remain in the pool for multiple blocks.
* Bugfixes and improvements
