# Releasenotes Threefold chain v1.1.0

If you apply this update directly from release `v1.0.7`,
than please also take into account the changes that were already released with version `v1.0.8`.

You can find the release notes for `v1.0.8` at: [/doc/release_notes/v1.0.8.md](/doc/release_notes/v1.0.8.md).

## Summary

* add two new transaction types:
  * (1) `MinterDefinitionTransaction` (Tx version `0x80`), to allow the redefinition of Coin Creators:
    * technical information about this transaction type can be found at: [/doc/transactions.md#minter-definition-transactions](/doc/transactions.md#minter-definition-transactions).
  * (2) `CoinCreationTransaction` (Tx version `0x81`), to allow the creation of coins:
    * technical information about this transaction type can be found at: [/doc/transactions.md#coin-creation-transactions](/doc/transactions.md#coin-creation-transactions).
* improvements to the Web Explorer:
  * simplify the used terminology to make it improve the UX for less tech-savvy people;
  * make it clear when an explorer is serving content from a non-`standard` network (e.g. `testnet`);
  * show Transaction Fee Payouts on the transaction hash pages;
  * support the visualization of basic statistics for unknown versions when looking up a transaction
    using a version not supported by the Web Explorer;
  * support the visualization of CoinCreation transactions;
  * show until when an atomic swap contract is locked for the refunder;
  * show the contract address for atomic swap contracts;
  * show the version of the web-explorer as footer information on all pages;
  * improve the hash-not-found page to make it more understandable for all our users;
  * base64-decode Arbitrary Data when showing it on the transaction hash pages;
  * add a block navigation menu, allowing you to easily click through the chain from block to block;
  * add a "You are here" navigation menu, to help you keep track of where you are.

## Upgrade concerns

* make sure to upgrade your _testnet_ full nodes to `v1.1.0` as soon as possible, or risk getting out-of-sync with the rest of the network due to your ConsensusSet not accepting the two new transaction types;
  * Note that when you run an existing node, that has just been upgraded, it will take a bit longer (1-2 minutes) the first time to load the daemon, as it will have to sync the new TransactionDB module automatically loaded for all tfchain daemons.
