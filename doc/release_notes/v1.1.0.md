# Releasenotes Threefold chain v1.1.0

If you apply this update directly from release `v1.0.7`,
than please also take into account the changes that were already released with version `v1.0.8`.

You can find the release notes for `v1.0.8` at: [/doc/release_notes/v1.0.8.md](/doc/release_notes/v1.0.8.md).

## Summary

* add a new transaction type, `CoinCreationTransaction` (Tx version `0x81`), to allow the creation of coins:
  * technical information about this transaction type can be found at: [/doc/transactions.md#coin-creation-transactions](/doc/transactions.md#coin-creation-transactions).
* some small improvements to the Web Explorer:
  * simplify the used terminology to make it improve the UX for less tech-savvy people;
  * make it clear when an explorer is serving content from a non-`standard` network (e.g. `testnet`);
  * show Transaction Fee Payouts on the transaction hash pages;
  * support the visualization of basic statistics for unknown versions when looking up a transaction
    using a version not supported by the Web Explorer;
  * support the visualization of CoinCreation transactions;
  * base64-decode Arbitrary Data when showing it on the transaction hash pages;

## Upgrade concerns

* make sure to upgrade your _testnet_ full nodes to `v1.1.0` as soon as possible, or risk getting out-of-sync with the rest of the network due to your ConsensusSet not accepting the new `CoinCreation` transactions;
