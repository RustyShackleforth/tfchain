# Releasenotes Threefold chain v1.1.2 (Alpha)

## Summary

- bug fixes to web explorer;
- introduce the TFT <-> TFT20 (an ERC20 ThreefoldFoundation-backed token on Ethereum) bridge:
    - it comes with a bridged CLI that forms a bridge between networks, allowing transfers of funds from one network to the other;
    - it introduces 3 new Transaction Types in the tfchain network to support this feature:
        - one to send funds from TFT to TFT20 ([Tx v208][Tx_v208]);
        - one to receive TFT funds from the TFT network ([v209][Tx_v209]);
        - one to register a TFT withdrawal address, required in order to be able to send TFT20 funds (back) to the TFT network) ([v210][Tx_v210]);
    - [Tx v208][Tx_v208] and [v210][Tx_v210] can be fully validated by any tfchain daemon;
    - [v209][Tx_v209] is by default only validated in light-mode. Only a tfchain daemon also connected to the linked Ethereum network can validate the ERC20-backed CoinCreation fully (a recommendation for all block creators);
- introduce support for 3Bot records:
    - you can read more about 3Bot in the context of tfchain at [/doc/3bot.md](/doc/3bot.md);
    - it comes with 3 new Transaction Types in the tfchain network to support this feature:
        - one to register a 3Bot, creating the record and getting a unique integral ID assigned as a result ([Tx v144][Tx_v144]);
        - one to update the record of an existing 3Bot ([Tx v145][Tx_v145]);
        - one to transfer the ownership of one or multiple names from one existing 3Bot to another ([Tx v146][Tx_v146]);

## Upgrade concerns

- make sure to upgrade your full node, connected to the _testnet_ ThreeFold Chain network, to `v1.1.2` immediately, as your node(s) will no longer sync otherwise;
